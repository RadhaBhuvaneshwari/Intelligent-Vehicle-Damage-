The project aims to streamline the insurance claims process by automating vehicle damage assessment and cost estimation using advanced image analysis and deep learning technology. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system can accurately identify and classify damaged areas in vehicle images uploaded by users, providing insights into the extent and severity of the damage. This approach not only expedites the claims process but also helps insurance companies make more informed decisions. Algorithms such as object detection, damage detection, and claim insurance processing are utilized to achieve these objectives, offering advantages like digitized claim processing and accurate damage assessment, albeit facing challenges such as manual claim processing delays and poor customer support. The system architecture incorporates functionalities for user authentication, image uploading, damage analysis, and insurance claim submission. With its ability to provide detailed analysis reports based on uploaded images, the proposed solution holds promise for improving efficiency and accuracy in the insurance industry.
